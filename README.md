# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study

This project, completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone, analyzes Cyclistic bike-share data to inform strategies for converting casual riders into annual members.

## Problem Statement

Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, aims to convert its casual riders into annual members to maximize profitability and long-term customer engagement. The core problem is to understand the behavioral differences between existing annual members and casual riders to develop targeted marketing strategies for conversion.

## Data Used

The analysis utilized publicly available historical Cyclistic trip data, specifically six months of ride information from Q1 2019 and Q1 2020. This dataset includes trip durations, start/end stations, bike types, and rider types (casual vs. member).

## Approach

I conducted a structured data analysis using **R** and the **tidyverse**. The approach involved: acquiring Cyclistic bike-share data, thorough cleaning and transformation, engineering key features (e.g., ride length, temporal data), performing extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating compelling visualizations. Insights derived from this process directly informed actionable business recommendations.

## Key Findings & Recommendations

Analysis revealed casual riders take longer weekend/leisure trips from tourist spots, while annual members make shorter weekday/commute trips from business hubs. Based on these distinct patterns, I recommended targeted promotions (for weekend/leisure use, highlighting membership value for longer trips), strategic station-based outreach, and emphasizing the utility of annual membership to effectively convert casual users.
